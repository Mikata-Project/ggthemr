\usage{
define_palette(swatch, gradient, background = "#ffffff",
  text = c("#444444", "#444444"), line = c("#6e6e6e", "#6e6e6e"),
  gridline = "#c3c3c3")

}
\arguments{
\item{swatch}{Vector of colours used for plotting data i.e. the main colours used for the points in geom_point(), bars in geom_bar() etc.}

\item{gradient}{A character vector of sequential colours, or a list of
arguments to be used with a specific gradient function. If a list is
provided, it should minimally specify one of the following sets of
arguments:

\itemize{
  \item{\code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_colour_continuous}}: \code{colour} or \code{color}}
  \item{\code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_colour_gradient2}}: \code{low}, \code{mid} and \code{high}}
  \item{\code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_colour_gradient}}: \code{low} and \code{high}}
}}

\item{background}{Background colour.}

\item{text}{Text colour. This should be either a single colour or a vector of two colours (see details).}

\item{line}{Axes line colour. This should be either a single colour or a vector of two colours (see details).}

\item{gridline}{Major and minor gridline colours.}
}
\value{
Object of type ggthemr_palette that you can pass to ggthemr().
}
\description{
Create a custom palette that can be used by ggthemr. Checks will be carried out to make sure colours are not duplicated and are appropriate (e.g. the text colour should not match the background colour or text will not be visible). 

Default colours for the background, text, axes lines and gridlines have been provided, but it is recommended that you overwrite these to make a nice theme.
}
\details{
The text and axes line colours can both be provided as single 
colours or vectors of two colours. If only one colour is provided then 
the text and line colours will be identical regardless of the theme 
type ("inner" or "outer", see \code{\link{ggthemr}} for more details). 
Where your palette doesn't really need different text/line colours for 
the theme type than it sufficient to supply only one colour but a 
warning will be issued.

Vectors supplied for the text and line colours can have elements named "inner" and "outer". In the absence of these names, the first will be assumed to be the "inner" colour, the second will be the "outer" colour.

\examples{
# Create ugly theme with primary colours.
ugly <- define_palette(
  swatch = c('black', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'brown', 'purple', 'yellow'), 
  gradient = c(lower = 'red', upper = 'green')
)
  
ggthemr(ugly)
